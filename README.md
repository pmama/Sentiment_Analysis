# ML for Sentiment Analysis 📊
I've embarked on a captivating project focused on sentiment analysis of customer 'Reviews for fine foods on Amazon'.  Using fundamental text processing techniques using the Natural Language Tool Kit (nltk) and the 'Vader' sentiment analysis model, I've been able to dive into the world of customer feedback and extract valuable insights.

Here's a glimpse into my project journey:
## 📋 Data Size Optimization: 
To manage runtime efficiently, I carefully selected a smaller subset of 10,000 records for analysis. This allowed me to work with a manageable dataset while still gaining valuable insights.

## 📝 Text Preprocessing with NLTK: 
Leveraging the power of NLTK, I performed essential text preprocessing tasks to ensure data quality and consistency. This step lays a solid foundation for accurate sentiment analysis.

## 🔍 Vader Sentiment Analysis:
I adopted the Vader sentiment analysis model to generate sentiment labels (the dependent variable). Vader is a robust choice for this task, providing quick and reliable sentiment categorization.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models: 
To predict sentiment labels, I employed both Naive Bayes and ensemble models. Through the use of 10-fold cross-validation, I achieved a commendable level of accuracy, showcasing the potential of these models in sentiment analysis tasks.

## 🎯 Room for Improvement: 
While the project has delivered promising results, there is significant room for enhancement. Hyperparameter tuning, a valuable technique for fine-tuning models, remains unexplored in this project. This presents an exciting opportunity to further boost accuracy and refine the models.

## 🌟 Future Prospects: 
My journey in sentiment analysis has been both rewarding and enlightening. As I continue to explore and learn, I'm eager to delve deeper into hyperparameter tuning and other advanced techniques to maximize the accuracy of sentiment analysis models.
